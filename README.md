# Competitive Programming

A curated collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. The code is from [indy256](https://github.com/indy256/codelibrary/tree/master/java/src)
and the categorisation is based on [Sibyter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.izaron.pepperpied)
